Map.cpp contains the source code for a simple demo of the standard libray map. In this case I have used map to act as a word counter for a user inputed text file(I have used Mody Dick by Herman Mervil acessed by Project Gutenberg). This code will acess the file, then create a map of string, int and read the file word for word converting the entries to lowercase and storing them in map. Lastly the contents of the map, that is the word and it's occurance will be wrote to a file created during run time.
